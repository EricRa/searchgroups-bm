Bookmarklets for searching

The point of these bookmarklets is simply to copy long search query strings to the clipboard with a single button push from the bookmarks toolbar in Firefox.

The main usage for me is to be able to search groups of sites all at once based on category.

## Setup

1) Create a new bookmark on your firefox bookmarks bar.

2) Name it whatever you want, and copy the full text of one of the bookmarklet files into the "URL" field.

3) Customize the sites you want to search

# Usage

Open a new tab, click the bookmarklet to copy the text, type your query into the address bar, and finally paste the text from the clipboard to search using your custom pre-formatted query.
